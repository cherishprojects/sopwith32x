Build or Install Sopwith
========================

Sopwith can be installed using the following instructions.


Installing from package manager
===============================

On Debian-based systems run 

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install sopwith 


Acquiring source code
=====================

The latest source code for Sopwith can be downloaded from GitHub at
https://github.com/fragglet/sdl-sopwith

This can be done by using git

     https://github.com/fragglet/sdl-sopwith.git

Alternatively the source code can be downloaded as an archive from

     https://github.com/fragglet/sdl-sopwith/releases

Releases can be unpacked using the command

     tar xf sopwith-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

Where X Y Z are the latest version numbers. 


Building from source
====================

Sopwith requires minimal dependencies and can usually be built with
just the following items: A C compiler, build system (make) and autoconf tools.

On Debian (and related Linux distributions) it is possible to build sopwith using
the following commands

    sudo apt install libsdl2-dev dh-autoreconf autogen build-essential

Then, in the sopwith top-level source code directory (sdl-sopwith) run

    ./configure && make

Or if building from Git:

    ./autogen.sh && make

Optionally you can then either run a local copy of Sopwith using:

    src/sopwith

Or install the program by running

    sudo make install

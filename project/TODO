To Do
-----

Bugs:

Code Cleanup: 
	Remove useless files: swutil.c
	Restructure game to be state based - avoids all the horrible crap
		with longjmp at the moment
Network:
	Ability to abort server
	Network disconnect should bring you back to the title screen
		Also on failure to connect
	> 2 Players, Teams
	Extra game modes -- Capture the flag etc

Documentation:
	Step-by-step install/build instructions, maybe in doc directory.


Ideas

Friendly buildings/tanks should shoot at enemy planes?
Teams (player + AI)?
Custom levels
High score table?
Safe base?
